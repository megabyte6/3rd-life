# 3rd Life
## What is it?
3rd Life is a Minecraft datapack implementing the ideas of YouTuber Grian's 3rd Life series. With a few tweaks from StormShadows and ImmortalFire927 of course. ;)

## Options
- All players:
    - `/trigger give_life` will put one of your lives into an item that you can give to others to help them. (It's recommended you use the corresponding [resource pack](https://github.com/megabyte6/3rd-life-resource-pack))
    - `/trigger time_left` to see how much time is left on the timer in minutes.
- Server admins:
    - `/function 3rd:start` to start game after everyone has joined the server.
    - It's recommended to use `/function 3rd:uninstall` to uninstall this datapack before removing it.
